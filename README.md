# Chess Game 
Chess game is a program written in java that runs in a terminal window(since I didn't know GUI at the time) that allows you to play chess 
PvP in command line interface using java compiler.

If you have java compiler beforehand, simply run the program. The instructions to play will be provided in runtime and hopefully you'll 
get aquainted fast. Works like fb chess in a way.

The Chess Game is Copyright under the GNU General Public License 2007 of the Free Software Foundation, thus, making it completely free 
to use, distribute and/or modify.

You must be extremely bored if you're playing this.
